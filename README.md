# only_connect_sim

## Background
On the British game show _Only Connect_, teams take turns picking from 6 hidden questions, without replacement (i.e. 6 questions -> 5 questions -> 4 questions...). In the first round, there is always a music question - and a running joke that every team tries to avoid it. Additionally, at the beginning of the game, the teams flip a coin and, wwhoever wins the toss decides which team will go _first_ or _second_ in the game. 

I became interested in whether going first or second confers a benefit of _not_ picking the music question to either team, or if it was equally probable - as expected.  So I created a quick simulation to test this.


## Results 
As expected, the order the teams go doesn't confer any advantage or drawback to either of them. But it was a fun exercise in basic simulation!


## Aftermath
Once I had completed the initial simulation, I atempted to generalize it, so the user can choose how big the the sample space is and how many teams there are.
